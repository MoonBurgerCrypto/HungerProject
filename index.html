      <h2>What is Starvation?</h2>
      <p>
        Starvation is an extreme form of malnutrition where the body lacks essential nutrients and calories to function.
        It results from long-term hunger and leads to organ damage, weakened immunity, and eventually death.
        It affects people of all ages but hits children and the elderly the hardest.
